            In the Van der Meer mansion, everyone is chatting while holding their
            champagne glasses. You are having fun but it's been a long night.
            Everyone is starting to say their goodbyes when a loud noise echoes
            through the air, chaos is installed, everyone is running around in
            panic. You all rush to the front door to find Amelia Van der Meer's body
            lying dead in the porch. What's happening? You have so many questions.
