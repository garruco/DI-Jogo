        In the Van der Meer mansion, everyone is chatting while holding their
        champagne glasses. You are having fun but it's been a long night.
        Everyone is starting to say their goodbyes when a loud noise echoes
        through the air, chaos is installed, everyone is running around in
        panic. You all rush to the front door to find Amelia Van der Meer's body
        lying dead in the porch. What's happening? You have so many questions.

        voice, wait... Amelia is alive! Now the choice is yours, will you help
        to change Amelia's fate or will it be... doomed?
